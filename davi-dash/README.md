## Problem statement: There are no good celo visualization dApps/dashboards that help users understand:
* Where you are spending cUSD & Celo 
* Where you are receiving cUSD & Celo
* What apps you are interacting with & the associated yields 
* Moola Market - (total x APY)
* UbeSwap - Liquidity pool yield
* How much you are sending to ImpactMarket

## How does this fit into the Celo ecosystem/core tenants:  

“Design for all” - *everyone should have access to their financial data and the tools to earn on their savings*

TL:DR - We think it would be really cool to build data tools to help everyday people, traders and refugees improve financial stability through financial insights such as where your money is coming from, how you’re spending it and what applications are helping you save for the future!


Questions for consideration:
Who is the ideal customer?
Is it someone interested in forecasting their yields from Moola, UbeSwap, etc?
Is this someone who uses Valora like a wallet and wants to see where they are sending/receiving money? 
Can we grab yield information from dAppKit or will we have access to those values inside Ube, Moola, etc?
